I believe the current iteration of this will override any existing claude.md, agents.md, hooks, skills, etc. I do not want this to happen. Instead, installing the plugin should add instructions to the existing files, notifying the user of conflicts and recommending solutions.

1: Verify current behavior.
2: Consider how to fix the current behavior to not override existing instructions and files, but instead add to or reprioritize those.
3: Implement changes. 
4: Test.
5: Report back.
